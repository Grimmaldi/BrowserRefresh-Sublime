{"name":"Browser Refresh","tagline":"Save the file you are working on and refresh your browser with one keystroke","body":"# Browser Refresh for Sublime Text\r\n\r\nThis plugin adds a keyboard shortcut to Sublime Text that will refresh the browser of your choice. Optionally the plugin can \"auto save\" your current file and bring the desired browser to the foreground.\r\n\r\nThe default keyboard shortcuts are:\r\n\r\n- **⌘ + Shift + R** (Mac)\r\n- **Ctrl + Shift + R** (Windows, Linux)\r\n\r\n### 1. Install the package\r\n**With the Package Control plugin**\r\nThe easiest way to install **Browser Refresh** is through Package Control, which can be found at [http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control).\r\n\r\n```\r\nUsing Package Manager search for \"Browser Refresh\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Without Git**\r\nDownload the latest source from GitHub and copy the BrowserRefresh folder to your Sublime Text \"Packages\" directory.\r\n\r\n**With Git**\r\nClone the repository in your Sublime Text \"Packages\" directory:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/gcollazo/BrowserRefresh-Sublime.git \"Browser Refresh\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### 1.1 On Linux\r\nInstall xdotool:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo apt-get install xdotool\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 2. Configure Key Bindings\r\nYou need to add the following to your `Key Bindings - User`. Go to `Preferences > Key Bindings - User` and add the following to that file and save. Without this step the plugin will not work.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n[\r\n    {\r\n        \"keys\": [\"command+shift+r\"], \"command\": \"browser_refresh\", \"args\": {\r\n            \"auto_save\": true,\r\n            \"delay\": 0.5,\r\n            \"activate\": true,\r\n            \"browsers\" : [\"chrome\"]\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n**auto_save**\r\nIf set to `true` you current file in Sublime Text will be saved before refreshing the browser window.\r\n\r\n**delay**\r\nAdds a delay (in seconds) before triggering the refresh. Seems to be useful if you are using a CSS or JavaScript pre-processor. The default is 0.0 seconds.\r\n\r\n**activate**\r\nIf set to `true` when you press the keys it will bring the browser to the foreground. **Note:** On Windows this setting is always `true`.\r\n\r\n**browsers**\r\nSpecify which browsers to refresh on command. The default is `chrome` which will try to refresh Google Chrome. You can change to be more specific using one of the following:\r\n\r\n| Browser                   | Setting      | Platforms       |\r\n|---------------------------|--------------|-----------------|\r\n| Google Chrome             | `chrome`     | Mac, Win, Linux |\r\n| Google Chrome Canary      | `canary`     | Mac, Win        |\r\n| Safari                    | `safari`     | Mac, Win        |\r\n| WebKit                    | `webkit`     | Mac             |\r\n| Firefox                   | `firefox`    | Mac, Win, Linux |\r\n| Firefox Developer Edition | `firefoxdev` | Mac             |\r\n| Opera                     | `opera`      | Mac, Win        |\r\n| Internet Explorer         | `ie`         | Win             |\r\n| SRWare Iron               | `iron`       | Win             |\r\n| Yandex                    | `yandex`     | Mac             |\r\n| Pale Moon                 | `palemoon`   | Win             |\r\n\r\n## Contributions\r\nIf you have the time to make this plugin better feel free to fork and submit a pull request.\r\n\r\n### Contributors\r\n* [Enrique Ramirez (enriquein)](https://github.com/enriquein)\r\n* [generalov](https://github.com/generalov)\r\n* [Tomáš Votruba (TomasVotruba)](https://github.com/tomasvotruba)\r\n\r\n## License\r\nAll of Browser Refresh for Sublime Text is licensed under the MIT license.\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2012 - 2015 Giovanni Collazo\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
